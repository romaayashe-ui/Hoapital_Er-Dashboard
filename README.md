1️⃣ Executive Summary
This Emergency Room (ER) performance analysis evaluates patient flow, wait times, demographic distribution, department referrals, and satisfaction metrics across 2023 and 2024.
The dashboard reveals:
9,000 total ER visits
Average wait time: 35.26 minutes
Average patient metric score: 6.73
The majority of cases required no department referral
Gender distribution is relatively balanced
Patient admissions show demographic concentration in specific racial groups
Overall, the ER demonstrates stable patient volume, moderate wait times, and controlled referral distribution. However, opportunities to optimize wait times and improve satisfaction remain.
2️⃣ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
KPI	Value	Interpretation
Total Patients: 9,000	High ER utilization
Average Wait Time	35.26 mins	Moderate – improvement opportunity
Average Patient Score	6.73 / 10	Acceptable but below excellence benchmark
Sum of Patients CM	480	Requires clarification (likely case management metric)
3️⃣ Patient Demographics Analysis
👥 Gender Distribution
The patient gender distribution is nearly balanced between male and female patients, with a small percentage categorized as “Not Confirmed.”
This indicates:
No significant gender-based volume imbalance
ER services are utilized evenly across genders
🌍 Admission Status by Patient Race
The largest admission volume comes from:
White patients (~3.6K)
African American (~2.0K)
Two or More Races (~1.6K)
Asian (~1.1K)
Declined to Identify (~1.0K)
Insight:
The distribution reflects demographic concentration and may align with the hospital’s geographic service area.
Recommendation:
Monitor satisfaction and wait time trends by demographic segment to ensure equity in care delivery.
4️⃣ Department Referral Analysis
Most patients (5.4K) required no department referral, indicating:
High resolution within ER
Effective triage handling
Top referral departments:
General Practice (~1.8K)
Orthopedics (~1.0K)
Physiotherapy (~0.3K)
Cardiology (~0.2K)
Neurology (~0.2K)
Gastroenterology (~0.2K)
Renal (~0.1K)
Operational Insight:
General Practice and Orthopedics are the highest secondary demand areas.
Recommendation:
Consider staffing optimization in General Practice.
Monitor orthopedic case patterns (injury-related trends).
5️⃣ Yearly & Age Distribution Analysis (2023 vs 2024)
The heatmap comparison shows:
Consistent patient distribution across age groups
Slight variation between 2023 and 2024
No extreme age concentration spikes
This suggests:
Stable ER demand patterns
No unusual age-driven crisis trends
Recommendation:
Further segmentation by:
Pediatric
Adult
Geriatric
Could improve staffing and resource allocation.
6️⃣ Patient Satisfaction Analysis
Satisfaction score range filter (0–10) indicates average score of 6.73.
Interpretation:
Patients are moderately satisfied
Service quality is acceptable but not outstanding
Primary driver likely:
35-minute average wait time
Industry benchmark for high-performing ERs:
20–25 minutes average wait
Recommendation:
Implement fast-track triage
Optimize peak hour staffing
Monitor high-delay time blocks
7️⃣ Operational Strengths
✔ High case resolution within ER
✔ Balanced demographic utilization
✔ Controlled referral distribution
✔ Stable yearly patient patterns
8️⃣ Areas for Improvement
⚠ Reduce average wait time below 30 minutes
⚠ Improve satisfaction score above 8.0
⚠ Monitor demographic equity metrics
⚠ Analyze peak admission hour
9️⃣ Strategic Recommendations
Introduce Fast Track for minor cases
Implement a predictive staffing model
Monitor referral load capacity
Perform satisfaction root-cause analysis
Add a time-of-day performance dashboard
🔟 Conclusion
The Emergency Room demonstrates operational stability and strong internal resolution capability. However, strategic focus on reducing wait times and improving patient satisfaction can significantly enhance overall performance and patient experience.

With data-driven resource optimization and targeted operational adjustments, the ER can transition from moderate performance to high-efficiency service excellence.
